*ESA 2024- Online, 7th Expo-Sciences Asia, hosted by MILSET, Kuwait.*

**Key Features & Implementation:**

-  Numerically analyzed how using CNT-reinforced cement concrete as a matrix material rather than conventional cement
concrete alters the seismic performance indicators.

-  Ran a linear Response Spectrum Analysis on around 3 multistoried RCC structure models [using ETABS] and
evaluated/graphically interpreted [using Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib] the magnitude of seismic performance indicators like
Storey Drift, Story Displacement, Storey Stiffness.

- Presented the project virtually in ESA 2024- Online, 7th Expo-Sciences Asia, hosted by MILSET, Kuwait.
