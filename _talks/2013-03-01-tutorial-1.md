*Coded a web application tailored for Kathmandu Metropolitan City to predict, monitor, and disseminate information about the air quality index (AQI)*

**Key Features & Implementation:**

-  Integrated three regression-based machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor) to provide accurate AQI predictions 

- An intuitive user interface prototype (UI based on Python-Streamlit) that allows the admin side of KMC to fetch accurate AQI predictions/visualizations, disseminate personalized recommendations/ email alerts for residents and the federal government, and enable station-wise mapping on Kathmandu Metropolitan Cityâ€™s map (using Python-Folium).

- Deployed and demonstrated through Streamlit

- Runner-Up | Prastav 2.0 (National Level Ideathon, 2025) | AI and Engineering Category
