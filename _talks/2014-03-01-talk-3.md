*A RAG-based AI agent specializing in the Regional Structural Engineering guidelines that assists a Structural Engineer based in Nepal and India during the design process through specialized sub-agents.*

- Used Google's Python Agent Development Kit (ADK) library.

- Used Gemini 2.5 Flash as our primary LLM Model.

- Implemented RAG Corpus through Google Cloud. The RAG Corpus contained all the necessary Indian Standard (IS) and Nepal-based codes that a structural engineer would need.

- Created a Root Agent that orchestrates the user query among 4 sub-agents and returns responses strictly adhering to the Engineering Codes concerned.

- Four sub-agents are: Concrete Mix Design Agent, RCC Structure Agent, Steel Structures Agent, and Nepal Building ByLaws Agent.

- Deployed the entire agent architecture on Google VertexAI
