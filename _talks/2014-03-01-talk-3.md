*A RAG-based AI agent specializing in Regional Structural Engineering guidelines that assists structural engineers in Nepal and India during the design process via specialized sub-agents.*

**Key Features & Implementation:**

- Utilized **Google's Python Agent Development Kit (ADK)** library.  
- Used **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as the primary LLM model.  
- Implemented **RAG Corpus on Google Cloud**, containing all relevant **Indian Standards (IS)** and **Nepal-based codes** for structural engineering.  
- Designed a **Root Agent** to orchestrate user queries among four sub-agents and ensure responses strictly adhere to applicable engineering codes.  
- **Sub-agents** include:  
  - Concrete Mix Design Agent  
  - RCC Structure Agent  
  - Steel Structures Agent  
  - Nepal Building ByLaws Agent  
- Deployed the entire agent architecture on **Google Vertex AI**.
