*A [Public Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength) was used to train 2 ML models (using Gradient Boosting Regressor and Cat Boost Regressor) that predict the compressive strength of concrete using 8 input features [Cement's mass (kg in a m^3 mixture), Blast Furnace's Slag Quantity, Fly Ash's Quantity, Water's Weight, Superplasticizer's Quantity, Coarse Aggregate's Quantity, Fine Aggregate's Quantity, Days of curing].*
