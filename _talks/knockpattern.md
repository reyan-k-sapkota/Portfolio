*A door lock system that initially stores the user entered sequence of knocks of a particular rhythm as an array. The values were assigned to the array on the basis of the pressure variation induced by each knock (pressure detected using Piezo Sensors). Later, to unlock the door, the user had to knock on the door with that initially stored rhythm. In short, the rhythm of the knocks was used as an equivalent of a “Password.”*
