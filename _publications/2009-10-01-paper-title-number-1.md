This paper proposes a web application prototype tailored for Kathmandu Metropolitan City to predict, monitor, and disseminate information about the Air Quality Index (AQI) from major stations in the valley. The application prototype integrates three regression-based machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor) to provide accurate AQI predictions. It also features an intuitive user interface (UI based on Python-Streamlit) that enables the admin side of KMC to retrieve accurate AQI predictions/visualizations, disseminate personalized recommendations/ email alerts to residents and the federal government, and facilitate station-wise mapping on Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s map (using Python-Folium).
