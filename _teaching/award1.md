*Issued by National Level Ideathon competition organized jointly by Kathmandu Valley Leo Club and CESS-Nepal. · Jan 2025*

**Key Features & Implementation:**
- Coded a web application tailored for Kathmandu Metropolitan City to predict, monitor, and disseminate information
about the air quality index (AQI)

- Integrated three regression-based machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, and
Gradient Boosting Regressor) to provide accurate AQI predictions an intuitive user interface (UI based on
Python-Streamlit) that allows the admin side of KMC to fetch accurate AQI predictions/visualizations, disseminate
personalized recommendations/ email alerts for residents and the federal government, and allow station-wise mapping
on Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s map (using Python-Folium).
